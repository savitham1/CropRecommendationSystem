# CropRecommendationSystem

Agriculture has been severely impacted by climate change due to unpredictable weather conditions. Picking the right crop to grow is one of the most crit- ical decision a farmer needs to make to gain maximum yield. Traditional techniques are not very effective due to the current uncertainties involved. However, a modern farming technique called Precision agriculture leverages Internet of Things and Machine Learning techniques to collect real time data and further analyze the data to make better decisions.

- Crop recommendation system applies classification techniques using Machine learning algorithms on real time data such as soil parameters, temperature, humidity, etc,. to recommend a crop for farmers to sow, helping them directly. 
- Gaussian Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, etc,. are amongst the list of algorithms used to develop models for this crop recommendation system.
- Performance of these models are compared based on their accuracy level, time and space complexity. 
- The algorithm that provides the best results is chosen for the application.
